# Actuarial-Science-and-Data-Science-with-Lifelib
The field of the actuarial sciences puts emphasis on the subjects of mathematics, probability and statistics, economics, finance, and risk management. There is a subject area, however, that is not given enough attention and is becoming more integrated into the profession of actuarial work. This subject, or rather tool, has the potential to automate much of the repetitive calculations and analyses that actuaries work through daily. This tool possesses the potential to change the actuarial field such that these highly skilled and intelligent professionals would be able to expend their time and energy on solving new problems, rather than repetitively making calculations that could be programmed into a computer.
